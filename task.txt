Assignment 1: Video Recording


Your first assignment is to record yourself answering the questions below in English. The video
should be up to 5 minutes long.
Questions:
1. Present yourself shortly to us.
2. Why do you want to become part of MentorMate?
3. Tell us a bit more about your experience with the Java technology stack.
Here are some tips on how to record your video:
● Shoot yourself in landscape (horizontal) for higher quality. If audio pickup isn't great,
use
headphones.
● Shoot yourself in good lighting, natural light is your best friend. Do not shoot yourself
in direct sunlight. Facing a window could be helpful.
● The shooting angle shouldn’t be much below or above your head. Just imagine
you’re talking to someone.
● Don’t talk too fast and try to pause between thoughts.
● Shorter is better than longer.
Upload the video to any Cloud (file transfer/sharing) platform - Youtube, Google Drive,
WeTransfer, pCloud, Dropbox, One Drive, etc. Make sure that the link is shared externally, so we
can open it. Please insert the link in the relevant field in the application form.

Assignment 2: Practical Task


Create a Java console application that generates monthly performance reports. The application
should :
● Receive a command-line argument that is path to JSON data file (format provided
below):
Data:
[
{
"name": "John Smith",
"totalSales": 250,
"salesPeriod": 10,
"experienceMultiplier": 0.5
},
{
"name": "David Prowless",
"totalSales": 250,
"salesPeriod": 10,
"experienceMultiplier": 0.5
}
]
● Receive a command-line argument that is path to JSON report definition file (format
provided below):
Report definition:
{
"topPerformersThreshold": 10,
"useExprienceMultiplier": false,
"periodLimit": 10
}
● Generate CSV (comma separated value) file containing the report results (example
below);
Result
Name , Score
John Smith, 12.5
David Prowess, 12.5

The generated report should contain the following columns:
● Name - Name of the employee;
● Score - result of the evaluation;
Resulting report file should contain only employees that:
● have sales period that is equal or less than the periodLimit property;
● have score that is within the top X percent of the results, where X is defined by the
topPerformersThreshold property of the report definition.
The score is calculated based on the following rules:
If useExprienceMultiplier is set to true:
Score = totalSales/salesPeriod*experienceMultiplier
If useExprienceMultiplier is set to false:
Score = totalSales/salesPeriod
Please upload the code for this project to GitHub and insert the link to your repository in
the relevant field in the application form.
